**FReD** is a distributed middleware for **F**og **Re**plicated **D**ata.
It abstracts data management for fog-based applications by grouping data into _keygroups_, each keygroup a set of key-value pairs that can be managed independently.
Applications have full control over keygroup replication: replicate your data where you need it.

FReD is maintained by [Tobias Pfandzelter, Trever Schirmer, and Nils Japke of the Mobile Cloud Computing research group at Technische Universit√§t Berlin and Einstein Center Digital Future in the scope of the FogStore project](https://www.tu.berlin/en/mcc).
Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) -- 415899119.
