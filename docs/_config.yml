# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

title: "FReD: Fog Replicated Data"
description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  **FReD** is a distributed middleware for **F**og **Re**plicated **D**ata.
  It abstracts data management for fog-based applications by grouping data into _keygroups_, each keygroup a set of key-value pairs that can be managed independently.
  Applications have full control over keygroup replication: replicate your data where you need it.
baseurl: "/FReD" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://openfogstack.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
