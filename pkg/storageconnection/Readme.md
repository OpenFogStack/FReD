# Installing GRPC
Theoretically all the generated files (`*.pb.go`) are already commited to this repo, so there is no need to install grpc.

If the files need to be changed / a new language binding needs to be created here are the install guidelines: https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/go/

On Arch it's a simple `yay -S grpc protobuf-go`.

The Go Files are generated by running `protoc --go_out=plugins=grpc:. --go_opt=paths=source_relative storage.proto` in this directory.

# General Idea behind this
There are two executables in cmd/: frednode and storageservice. Both can access this code, but one uses it to send messages and the other to receive messages.
